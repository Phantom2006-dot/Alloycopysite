### 5. Database Schema
Use PostgreSQL with the following tables:

- media_items (books, films, tv shows)
- team_members
- events
- uploads (media library)
- settings (site configuration)

### 6. Technical Requirements
**Backend:**
- Node.js with Express or similar
- PostgreSQL database
- JWT authentication for admin
- File upload handling (local or cloud storage)
- Image processing (sharp for optimization)
- Input validation
- Rate limiting
- CORS configuration
**Admin Panel Options:**
Option A: Build custom React admin dashboard
Option B: Use Strapi headless CMS
Option C: Use Payload CMS (TypeScript native)
**Frontend Integration:**
- Use existing React Query setup for data fetching
- Add new routes for blog pages
- Create reusable components for article cards, etc.
- Implement SEO with react-helmet or similar
---
### 7. Deployment Considerations
- Backend API on same domain or subdomain
- Database: Replit PostgreSQL or external (Neon, Supabase)
- Media storage: Local or Cloudinary/S3
- Environment variables for all secrets
- Production build optimization
---
## PRIORITY ORDER
1. Set up database and basic API structure
2. Create admin authentication system
3. Build article/blog CRUD operations
4. Create admin panel for content management
5. Add media library management
6. Build frontend blog pages
7. Integrate with existing pages (replace static data with API)
8. Add SEO and performance optimizations
9. Set up scheduled publishing
10. Add analytics/view tracking
---
## DESIGN REFERENCE
The blog should match the existing BAUHAUS site aesthetic:
- Clean, minimal layout
- Serif headings (Playfair Display) + Sans-serif body (Inter)
- Plenty of whitespace
- Professional, editorial feel
- Smooth animations
- Dark/light mode support
Similar to alloyentertainment.com's blog structure where news and updates are cleanly organized by category with prominent imagery.

Please help me implement this CMS step by step, starting with the database schema and backend API, then the admin panel, and finally integrating the blog with my existing React frontend.
