I want you to redesign my site UI in both light mode and dark mode.

1. Make BLACK and WHITE the main foundation colors for the entire site.
   - Light mode: mostly WHITE backgrounds with BLACK text.
   - Dark mode: mostly BLACK or deep charcoal backgrounds with WHITE text.

2. Use the following colors ONLY as accent and design elements:
   #ffd51e, #ff3131, #9655f0, #9c43fa, #7ee868, #2fdeab, #3faf90, #57abbe, #4ea8f1, #cc3bba, #24dc32, #f15d24, #e97bff, #dd07a6
   These should not overpower the UI — keep them subtle for highlights, buttons, icons, borders, gradients, hover effects, or section dividers.

3. Create two full color palettes:
   - Light mode palette
   - Dark mode palette
   Each must include:
   - Primary background
   - Primary text color
   - Secondary surface color
   - Accent color set
   - Color tokens as CSS variables

4. Add usage examples:
   - Buttons
   - Cards
   - Section backgrounds
   - Navigation bar
   - Footer
   - Highlighted text or CTA areas

5. The site must confirm that all dynamic content under each section is working correctly.    -remove the static contents,  in sections like events
   - Verify that dynamic data loads
   - Confirm components update in real time
   - Make sure mapped or fetched content displays properly
   - Ensure light/dark mode switching also updates dynamic sections

6. Center the logo in the top navigation/tab by adding tv from the tv.tsx in the page folder for both modes. 

7. The logo filenames should match the theme:
   - For light mode, the logo file must be: **light.png**
   - For dark mode, the logo file must be: **dark.png**

8. Finally, output the results in a structured format:
   - Light mode palette + CSS variables
   - Dark mode palette + CSS variables
   - UI usage examples
   - Updated layout instructions (with centered logo)
   - Sections confirming dynamic functionality     add the username and password as admin and admin123, and set it up in the database
